###making this work with anything

brenda listen alright you gotta be more specific and branch out a bit more m'kay lemme show you what i mean
okay so
you gotta change the settings.cfg so that you have the API keys from your twitter app, don't leave spaces btw do it right after the colon
and then in the main.py you need to edit the domain to the one you want m'kay
then you gotta put the line of html you want to update from in the next ones that have html in them
then you go down and edit the string to what you want, so like when it says quote + "as of blah blah" you wanna edit that bit
after that you gotta change some stuff in the cron job but you know how to do that
and um okay that's kinda it really, like appspot does the rest

oh yeah you need appspot too, and a twitter app with read & write
get that on the internet idfk
